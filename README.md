Docker interview questions


What is a Docker Compose, and why is it useful?
A. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It's useful for managing complex applications with multiple services, enabling easy orchestration.



What is Docker Swarm, & how does it differ from Kubernetes?
A. Docker Swarm is Docker's native orchestration tool for managing clusters of Docker hosts.
Kubernetes is a more robust orchestration system that can manage containers from different providers.


How do you achieve high availability in Docker Swarm?
A. To achieve high availability in Docker Swarm, you should run multiple manager nodes in a Swarm cluster. This ensures that if one manager node fails, others can take over. 



What is Docker volume, and why would you use it?
A. Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers. They provide a way to share data between containers and make it durable even if the container is stopped or removed. 


Explain the concept of Docker overlay network.
A. Docker overlay network is a network type that allows containers to communicate securely across multiple Docker hosts in a Swarm cluster. It abstracts the underlying network infrastructure. 


What is Dockerfile, and how do you create one?
A. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. You create one by specifying a base image, adding files, and running commands to configure the image.


What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?
A. CMD specifies the default command to run when the container starts, but it can be overridden at runtime. ENTRYPOINT sets the primary command and cannot be easily overridden. 


How can you pass environment variables to a Docker container?
A. You can pass environment variables to a Docker container using the -e flag when running the docker run command or by defining them in a Compose file or Dockerfile.


What is Docker Healthcheck, and why is it important?
A. Docker Healthcheck is a feature that allows you to define a command to check the health of a container.
It helps ensure that only healthy containers are considered for load balancing or scaling.


How do you optimize Docker images for size?
A. To optimize Docker images, use multi-stage builds to reduce the number of layers, remove unnecessary files, and use smaller base images like Alpine Linux.


What is Docker content trust, and why should you enable it?
A. Docker Content Trust is a security feature that uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity of images. Enabling it helps ensure that only signed and trusted images can be run.


Explain the role of Docker Registry in container distribution.
A. Docker Registry is a service that stores and distributes Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry, but you can also set up your private registry for enhanced security.


How do you manage secrets in Docker Swarm services?
A. You can use Docker's built-in secret management feature to securely store and access sensitive data like passwords and API keys in Swarm services.


What is the purpose of Docker image caching, and how can you control it?
A. Docker image caching speeds up image builds by reusing previously built layers. You can control caching with the --no-cache flag or by specifying a build context.


How can you ensure your Docker containers are running with the least privilege principle?
A. Use Docker's security options, like --cap-drop and
--cap-add flags, to limit container capabilities and run containers with the minimum privileges required.


What are Docker labels, and how can they be used?
A. Docker labels are key-value pairs that can be added to containers and images. They are useful for adding metadata, organization, and filtering when managing containers.


Explain Docker BuildKit and its benefits.
A. Docker BuildKit is a modern build subsystem that provides improved performance, security, and extensibility for image builds. It offers advanced features like cache import/export.


How do you monitor Docker containers and services in production?
A. Tools like Docker Swarm's built-in metrics, Prometheus, and Grafana can be used for monitoring. You can also explore Docker Enterprise solutions for advanced monitoring.


What is Docker Security Scanning, and why is it important?
A. Docker Security Scanning is a feature that scans Docker images for vulnerabilities. It's crucial to identify and address security issues in containerized applications. 


How can you optimize container orchestration for cost efficiency?
A. Implement auto-scaling and resource limits, use spot instances in the cloud, and regularly review resource utilization to optimize costs in container orchestration.


Explain Docker Compose Overrides and Profiles.
A. Docker Compose Overrides allow you to define and apply different configurations for the same Compose file, while Profiles let you manage multiple sets of services. 



How do you perform rolling updates in Docker Swarm services?
A. Rolling updates in Docker Swarm can be achieved by updating the service's image or configuration, and Swarm will automatically roll out the changes with minimal downtime. 


What is the difference between Docker rootless mode & privileged mode?
A. Docker rootless mode runs containers with reduced privileges, enhancing security. Privileged mode grants full access to the host system & should be avoided for security reasons. 


How can you achieve zero-downtime deployments in Docker Swarm?
A. To achieve zero-downtime deployments, use rolling updates, health checks, and update strategies like parallelism and delay to gradually replace containers with new versions.


What are Docker plugins, & how can they extend Docker's functionality?
A. Docker plugins are external extensions that can add new capabilities to Docker, such as volume drivers, network drivers, & authorization plugins.
They enhance Docker's flexibility & functionality.


Explain Docker build cache, its benefits, & how you can optimize it further.
A. Docker build cache stores intermediate layers during image builds to speed up subsequent builds.
You can optimize it by leveraging BuildKit's advanced caching options & cleaning up old images.


Describe Docker multi-stage builds & provide an example of when to use them. 
A. Multi-stage builds involve using multiple FROM instructions in a Dockerfile to create intermediate imgs & produce a final img. Dey r useful for creating small prod imgs from large build env's.


What is Docker context and how can it improve Docker build performance?
A. Docker context is the set of files used during a docker build. By optimizing the context, you can reduce the time and resources required for image builds, resulting in improved build performance.
